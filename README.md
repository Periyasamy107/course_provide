## <ins> Summary of the project : </ins>
Full-stack web development involves proficiently managing both the frontend and backend aspects of web applications. Frontend development focuses on creating the user-facing interface, employing languages like HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Full-stack developers utilize frontend frameworks such as React.js or Angular to streamline UI development. On the backend, developers implement server-side logic using languages like Node.js, Python, or Ruby, alongside databases like MySQL or MongoDB for data storage and retrieval. They design APIs to facilitate communication between frontend and backend components, ensuring seamless data exchange. Understanding version control with tools like Git and deployment strategies is crucial for maintaining code integrity and deploying applications effectively.
